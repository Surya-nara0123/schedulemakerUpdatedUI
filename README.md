### This is a project we started in our first year, we very much regret the choices we made for most of the code in here, but it works so gonna roll with it.

This is a **class scheduling tool for professors** built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It helps faculty efficiently organize class schedules, labs, and faculty availability.

## Features

- **Class Scheduling** – Professors can schedule classes, labs, and other sessions.
- **Locking System** – Lock specific classes or entire classes timetables before making further changes.
- **Blocked Time Slots** – Restrict specific times for labs and professor availability.
- **Preconfigured Timings** – Some faculty, like adjunct professors, can have predefined schedules.
- **Auto-Updating UI** – Changes reflect instantly while developing.
- **Simple and Lightweight** – Built with Next.js for speed and efficiency.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use the application.

You can start editing by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The app auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for font optimization and loads [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern font family from Vercel.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this app is via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app), the creators of Next.js.
